# open-meteo-langchain-interactive-notebook-demo
An interactive jupyter notebook, using open meteo and langchain to get weather data.

This repo is inspired by [Arjan Codes](https://github.com/ArjanCode) Langchain [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4mFqyqFkxg&ab_channel=ArjanCodes)

It expands on the material in the tutorial by using a jupyter notebook and widgets to make an interactive space for interacting with the LLM.

It also incorperates geopy for converting human readable names to coordinates (geodocing) and plotly to create basic weather graphs from the returned data.
